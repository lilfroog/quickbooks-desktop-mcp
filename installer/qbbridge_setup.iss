; Inno Setup script for QBBridge.
;
; Build order (see installer/README.md):
;   1. PyInstaller builds dist/qbbridge-mcp.exe and dist/configure_claude_desktop.exe
;   2. build_skill_zip.py packages skills/qbbridge-bookkeeping/ into a
;      ready-to-upload zip (Claude's Skills upload expects a zip whose top
;      level is the skill's own folder, not SKILL.md at the zip root).
;   3. This script packages everything into one installer. It auto-registers
;      the MCP server with Claude Desktop's config (no hand-editing JSON),
;      but CANNOT auto-install the skill itself -- confirmed there is no
;      documented file-location, API, CLI, or URI-scheme path for that;
;      Claude Desktop requires a manual upload through its own UI for
;      anything that shapes its behavior. NEXT_STEPS.txt, opened
;      automatically at the end of setup, walks the user through that one
;      remaining manual step with the exact file path to upload.
